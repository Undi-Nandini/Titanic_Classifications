# Data set
I taken a data set from Kaggle. The "titanic_data.csv" dataset includes columns such as PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, and Embarked, containing information about passenger details, survival status, ticket class, name, gender, age, family relations, ticket details, fare, cabin number, and port of embarkation, respectively.
# Titanic_Classifications
Welcome to the Titanic Classification repository, where the fascinating realm of data science meets the historic Titanic voyage. This project delves into predicting passenger survival using machine learning techniques. Through extensive dataset exploration, we uncover insights into demographics, family relations, and fares, visualized via EDA techniques. A meticulous data preprocessing phase ensures a refined dataset for our Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Trained on historical information, the model undergoes rigorous evaluation with metrics like precision and recall.
